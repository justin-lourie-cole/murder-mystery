		name: "Gordon",
		weapon: "The Whiteboard Wipe",
		room: "The Creative Corner",
		backstory:
			"Gordon is the Creative Director who believes he's a modern-day Picasso, but his ideas are more like finger paintings. He spends most of his time in the Creative Corner, where he 'borrows' ideas from his team and presents them as his own.",
		motive:
			"When the victim accidentally spilled coffee on Gordon's latest 'masterpiece' (a doodle of a cat with a monocle), Gordon panicked. Fearing the truth would come out—that he had no original ideas—he grabbed the Whiteboard Wipe and used it to erase the evidence... and the victim!",

			"Mike is the tech genius who claims he can code in his sleep. Unfortunately, he often does, leading to some 'interesting' software updates. He keeps all his top-secret projects on his USB Drive of Secrets, which he treats like a prized pet.",
		motive:
			"When the victim discovered that Mike was using the agency's resources to develop a dating app for cats, Mike panicked. In a desperate attempt to protect his feline matchmaking dreams, he swung the USB Drive like a ninja star, declaring, 'You'll never find my cat-tastic algorithms now!'",

		room: "The Break Room of Betrayal",
		backstory:
			"Justin is the charming account exec who believes he can sell ice to Eskimos. He's often found in the Break Room of Betrayal, where he brews coffee strong enough to wake the dead—perfect for those 'urgent' client meetings.",
		motive:
			"When the victim threatened to spill the beans about Justin's 'creative' expense reports (who knew a trip to the beach could be a client meeting?), Justin thought, 'What would Batman do?' He grabbed his Coffee Mug of Justice and delivered a caffeinated smackdown, declaring, 'Justice is brewed!'",

		name: "Shalini",
		weapon: "The Paperclip Catapult",
		room: "The Marketing Maze",
		backstory:
			"Shalini is the data wizard who can turn numbers into gold—or at least into a mildly interesting PowerPoint. She often experiments with quirky presentations in the Marketing Maze, where her ideas sometimes get lost in translation.",
		motive:
			"When the victim publicly questioned Shalini's 'groundbreaking' findings that cats are better than dogs (a highly controversial study), she snapped. In a fit of rage, she constructed a Paperclip Catapult and launched a barrage of paperclips, shouting, 'You'll regret questioning my feline research!'",

		backstory:
			"Su is the social media queen who can turn any mundane moment into a viral sensation. She spends her days in the Zoom Zone, where she hosts meetings that somehow always devolve into cat videos.",
		motive:
			"When the victim threatened to reveal Su's secret of buying followers (shocking, I know!), she panicked. In a fit of creativity, she unleashed a Post-It Note Bomb during a Zoom call, covering everyone in sticky notes and declaring, 'You're all now part of my new viral campaign!'",

	{
		name: "Gerard",
		weapon: "The Printer Jam",
		room: "The Supply Closet of Secrets",
		backstory:
			"Gerard is the agency's legal eagle, known for his ability to make problems disappear faster than you can say 'conflict of interest.' He spends most of his time in the Supply Closet of Secrets, where he keeps a stash of 'legal loopholes' (and snacks).",
		motive:
			"When the victim caught Gerard trying to shred incriminating documents (and a few of his lunch receipts), Gerard panicked. He caused a Printer Jam, claiming it was an 'office emergency,' and used the chaos to sneak out, leaving the victim to deal with the paper disaster—permanently!",
